## **Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to create a unified system that allows a custom chatbot to retrieve real-time server data by integrating with the ServerAPI SDK installed on various servers. When a user asks a question to the chatbot regarding any server, the chatbot connects to the SDK's API and retrieves the relevant information to display in the chat view.

## **Components**

### 1. **ServerAPI SDK**
The ServerAPI SDK is a lightweight, installable package designed to expose key server data through a RESTful API. This SDK can be installed on any server to provide real-time information about the server's status, performance, and configurations.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Minimal resource usage to ensure smooth performance on different server types.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Exposes standard endpoints to retrieve server information.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Secure**: Supports authentication and encryption.

#### **API Endpoints:**
1. **`GET /status`**: Retrieves the current status of the server (e.g., uptime, CPU usage, memory usage).
2. **`GET /config`**: Provides the server's configuration details.
3. **`GET /logs`**: Fetches recent logs from the server.
4. **`GET /health`**: Returns the health status of various server components.
5. **`GET /custom/:metric`**: Allows querying custom metrics defined on the server.

#### **Installation:**
The SDK can be installed via a package manager or manually:
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install serbot-sdk`
- **Windows**: `working in progress`
- **macOS**: `working in progress`

#### **Configuration:**
After installation, the SDK requires minimal configuration. Example configuration file (`serverapi.conf`):
```ini
[server]
name = MyServer
port = 8080
auth_token = <generated_token>
```

### 2. **Custom Ollama Chatbot**
The custom Ollama chatbot is a conversational interface designed to interact with users and retrieve server-related information by querying the ServerAPI SDK.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: The chatbot uses advanced NLP techniques to understand server-related queries.
- **Dynamic API Calls**: Based on user input, the chatbot dynamically determines the appropriate API endpoint to query.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Ensures low-latency responses by optimizing API calls and caching frequently requested data.

#### **Workflow:**
1. **User Input**: The user asks a question, such as "What is the current CPU usage on Server A?"
2. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot identifies the intent (e.g., "server status query") and extracts entities (e.g., "Server A").
3. **API Query**: The chatbot connects to the ServerAPI SDK installed on the specified server and queries the relevant endpoint.
4. **Response Generation**: The chatbot formats the retrieved data into a user-friendly response.
5. **Display**: The chatbot displays the response in the chat view.

#### **Example Interaction:**
**User**: "Show me the health status of Server B."

**Chatbot**: "Fetching health status from Server B..."

**Chatbot**: "Server B Health Status:

- CPU: 65% usage
- Memory: 70% usage
- Disk: 80% usage (Warning)
- Network: Stable"

### **User Flow**

1. **User** interacts with the chatbot via a chat interface.
2. **Custom Ollama Chatbot** processes the query and determines the appropriate server and endpoint.
3. **ServerAPI SDK** provides the requested data by exposing RESTful API endpoints.

### **Deployment**

#### **ServerAPI SDK Deployment:**
1. Install the SDK on all target servers.
2. Configure the SDK with necessary authentication and server details.
3. Start the SDK service on each server.

#### **Chatbot Deployment:**
1. Deploy the chatbot on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise.
2. Ensure the chatbot has network access to all servers running the ServerAPI SDK.
3. Configure authentication tokens for secure communication.

### **Security Considerations**
- **Authentication**: Ensure that all API requests are authenticated using tokens.
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for all communications between the chatbot and the SDK.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the chatbot and SDK for anomalies.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Multi-Language Support**: Extend chatbot support to multiple languages.
2. **AI-Driven Insights**: Use machine learning to provide predictive insights (e.g., potential server failures).
3. **Custom Alerts**: Allow users to set up custom alerts for specific metrics.
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Integrate with third-party dashboards for visual representation of server data.

### **Conclusion**
This system provides a scalable and efficient way to query and monitor server data through a conversational interface. By combining the lightweight ServerAPI SDK with a custom chatbot, users can gain real-time insights into their servers without needing to navigate complex monitoring tools.
